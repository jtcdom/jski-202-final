# Essay 4: Paul

## Prompt: 
Summarize Paul’s arguments
against the Judaizers in the probatio of
Galatians. Explain what justification
means for Paul. Present his arguments
against the Judaizers' claims that works
of the law justify. If the law does not
justify, why then did God give the law?
How does a correct reading of St. Paul
help to engage the Lutheran theology of
“justification by faith alone”? 

## Essay:

### Four arguments in Probatio of Galatians:
   1. The Galatians themselves very obviously
   received the Spirit when they were
   first evangelized. But at that
   point the Galatians did not follow
   the Mosaic Law. Therefore the Mosaic
   Law is not required for one to
   receive the Spirit. The Judaizers are
   "Going back from the Spirit to the
   flesh." Do people work miracles by
   the Law or by Faith?

2. Abraham "believed God, and it was
   reckoned to him as righteousness"
   (Gen 15:6). Therefore people who
   _believe_, who have Faith, are the true sons of
   Abraham.

3. If you don't follow the law
   perfectly, you are "cursed." But
   nobody can follow the law
   perfectly. Therefore anyone who
   trusts in the law is just cursing
   themselves. The law is kind of a
   curse, and Christ redeemed us from it
   by taking on the curse. Habbakuk
   says that "he who is righteous
   through faith shall live," but the
   law does not work through faith.

4. God promised Abraham that he would
   bless his offspring. The Mosaic Law
   came later (430 years), and does not change that
   promise - God will still save us.
   We are saved, therefore, by the
   promise, not the law (if God added
   new rules you had to follow to be
   saved, He would break his promise).

### Why was the law given?
1. Because of transgressions.
2. To protect Israel from the sinful
   world.
3. Ask Jski about this one. I can only
   find 2 in the passages he points out.

### Contra Luther
We are justified not by
circumcision, but by "faith working
through love" (Gal 5:6).

#### What does Paul mean by faith?
1. trust 
2. intellectual assent
3. the grace that helps you to have intellectual assent
4. the thing believed 
5. lived belief

Luther has first 3/4, but paul has all 5 (because "lived belief" is works).

#### How Unrighteous Larry is saved:
To be saved, Larry must first recieve
God's free gift of Prevenient Grace.
Then, he must cooperate with God's
grace the whole way. Larry needs grace
at every moment.
