# Essay 3: Peter
_a lot of this is from Noah's study
guide for the quiz_

## Prompt:
What do the Gospels teach
us about the ministry of Peter, and
consequently, the role of the Papacy in
the Church?  Be sure to discuss all
three major Petrine passages in the
Gospels. 

## Essay:

### Petrine Passage 1: Mt 16:18
"You are Peter, and on this rock I will
build my church . . . I will give you
the keys to the kingdom of Heaven, and
whatever you bind/loose on earth will be
bound/loosed in Heaven."

- Peter is the foundation stone of the
  Church, like the big rock that the
  Temple was built on.

- Peter has the keys to Heaven, so he is
  Christ's steward, charged with taking
  care of the Kingdom until the Master
  returns.

- Peter can "bind and loose," so he can
  give authoritative judgements on
  matters of faith and morals. This
  power is eventually given to the
  Apostles as a whole, but Peter as an
  individual gets it first. The "bind
  and loose" clause is better translated
  as "whatever you bind/loose on earth
  _will have been_ bound in Heaven,"
  which makes more sense because Peter
  doesn't define what is true, he is
  just protected from being wrong (Papal
  infallibility).

### Petrine Passage 2: Lk 22:31
"But I have prayed for you, that your
faith may not fail, and when you have
returned, strengthen/confirm your
brethren."

- Peter's faith is protected by Christ.

- Popes will sometimes use the phrase
  "confirming the brethren" when they
  are defining a doctrine.

### Petrine Passage 3: Jn 21:15.
"Do you love me? Feed my sheep."

- Peter is the shepherd of the Church.
  Not just some of it - the entire
  flock (even the
  clergy/bishops/cardinals, who might be
  signified by "sheep" because they are
  elders).
