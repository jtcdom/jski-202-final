# Fill In the Blank Section

## Section 1: Parts of a Pauline Letter

1. Praescriptio
The greeting.

  God for some good thing that the
  community has.

2. Exordium
Brief introduction that sets the tone.

3. Narratio
Tells the backstory of the current
situation.

4. Propositio

5. Probatio
The proof of the thesis.

Emotional appeal to do what Paul has
proved you should do.

7. Postscriptum

## Section 2: Revelation and Fuentes

### Revelation (4 schools of analysis)

1. Preterist
All of the events prophesied in
Revelation happened in the age of the
first Christians.

2. Futurist
The events prophesied in Revelation
have not happened yet, so when they
happen you'll know that the world is
about to end.

3. Historical
All/most of the events prophesied in
Revelation have happened already, but
they were spread throughout history and
not just in the age of the first
Christians.

4. Idealist
The prophecies in Revelation do not
refer to singular events, but rather to
_types_ of events that will occur in
every age, e.g., both Nero and Hitler
were "The Antichrist."

#### 1 Thessalonians
- It doesn't matter if you're alive or
  dead when the Second Coming
  ("Parousia") happens.

#### 2 Thessalonians
- The Second Coming cannot be imminent,
  because the "Rebellion" and
  "Antichrist" have not yet come.

#### 1 Corinthians
- Virginity is a good thing
- Various other topics

#### 2 Corinthians
- Prelude to an in-person visit
- Paul is a real Apostle; the false
  apostles aren't.

#### Galatians
- Against the Judaizers
- Faith saves, not works of the law

#### Romans
- Dogmatic part: The only route out of
  the sin we're all in is through Jesus.
  We are saved by Faith and Baptism.
- Moral part: Describes how a Christian
  should act.

#### Ephesians
- Everyone is called to be a Christian,
  even Gentiles
- Christians should be united

#### Phillippians
- Nice friendly letter
- Exhorts Phillipians to be ever better
  athletes of Christ as they seek
  holiness
- Christ was humble

#### Colossians
- Written against semi-Judaizers who
  also emphasized angels more than
  Christ
- Christ is way more important than the
  angels
- Things from without don't matter (e.g.
  non-kosher food doesn't defile you). It's
  what comes from inside that counts.

#### Philemon
- Carried by a runaway slave back to his
  master; about slavery
- Slaves and masters are equal as
  Christians, even though they are
  unequal in society

#### 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus
- Sent to the pastors of churches
- Avoid heresy
- How to organize your church
- Written when Apostolic authority was
  being passed on to their successors

#### Hebrews
- Canonical, but we don't know if Paul
  was the one who wrote it. Maybe one of
  his successors actually wrote it down.
- Written to exiled Jewish Christians
- Don't go back to Judaism -
  Christianity is better.
- Have faith, like the saints of the Old
  Testament did
