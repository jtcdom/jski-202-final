#### 1 Thessalonians
- It doesn't matter if you're alive or
  dead when the Second Coming
  ("Parousia") happens.

#### 2 Thessalonians
- The Second Coming cannot be imminent,
  because the "Rebellion" and
  "Antichrist" have not yet come.

#### 1 Corinthians
- Virginity is a good thing
- Various other topics

#### 2 Corinthians
- Prelude to an in-person visit
- Paul is a real Apostle; the false
  apostles aren't.

#### Galatians
- Against the Judaizers
- Faith saves, not works of the law

#### Romans
- Dogmatic part: The only route out of
  the sin we're all in is through Jesus.
  We are saved by Faith and Baptism.
- Moral part: Describes how a Christian
  should act.

#### Ephesians
- Everyone is called to be a Christian,
  even Gentiles
- Christians should be united

#### Phillippians
- Nice friendly letter
- Exhorts Phillipians to be ever better
  athletes of Christ as they seek
  holiness
- Christ was humble

#### Colossians
- Written against semi-Judaizers who
  also emphasized angels more than
  Christ
- Christ is way more important than the
  angels
- Things from without don't matter (e.g.
  non-kosher food doesn't defile you). It's
  what comes from inside that counts.

#### Philemon
- Carried by a runaway slave back to his
  master; about slavery
- Slaves and masters are equal as
  Christians, even though they are
  unequal in society

#### 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus
- Sent to the pastors of churches
- Avoid heresy
- How to organize your church
- Written when Apostolic authority was
  being passed on to their successors

#### Hebrews
- Canonical, but we don't know if Paul
  was the one who wrote it. Maybe one of
  his successors actually wrote it down.
- Written to exiled Jewish Christians
- Don't go back to Judaism -
  Christianity is better.
- Have faith, like the saints of the Old
  Testament did
